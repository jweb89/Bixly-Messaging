# To run project
- npm install
- npm start
- navigate to http://localhost:3000 on your browser

# Technical Considerations
- React
- React Router Dom for routing
- Bootstrap for quick and simple styling and mobile optimization
- React Hooks for all state management
- React Toastify for toasts related to errors and successful requests
- Axios for sending requests
- Formik for login and message forms
- Javascript time ago for message item
- React icons for carrot icons(Message Form) and trash icon

# If I wanted to make the project even better
- Work on styling using SASS, it is currently very basic.
- Probably use Redux. I could have used Redux but I felt like it wasn't super neccesary because the application was fairly simple. I did go back and forth about it since the props and request logic was a bit tricky but I ended up using some callback functions to get things working properly. If the app was anymore robust I would have used it.
- Build out my own forms instead of using Formik
